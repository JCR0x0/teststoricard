# teststoricard

## Description
A simple python app that processes all files in a directory. The file contain a list of debit/credit transactions on an account in csv format.
Transactions could be Credit transactions, marked with + symbol, or Debit transaction, marked with - symbol.

An execution the program show the next information based on the file:
Total balance is 39.74
Number of transactions in July: 2
Number of transactions in August: 2
Average debit amount: -15.38
Average credit amount: 35.25

All the transactions are write in a sqlite db

When finish the process the app will send a email with this information.

## Assumptions 
- We are talking about the same client int this exercise
- For the propouse of evaluation there are no restriction about insertion in DB
- The DB never will be read
- As this is a exercise, the "from" mail and "to" mail are the same. And always be a gmail account. I created an gmail account for this.
- It is necessary to see the result on the terminal
- It is necessary run the app as stand alone app
- For simplicity reasons all the code is in a single script
- The mounted directory is only to share the csv files, so, we dont need a volume

## Parts
- **app.py:** All the program
- **stori.jpg:** unedited logo image 
- **txns.csv:** demo file
- **env:** environment variables file

## Environment variables
- **SC_PRINT_DB_TRANSACTIONS:** *(YES/NO)*: Print at the end of each file all the data in the DB

- Copy *app.py,stori.jpg and txns.csv* in the same dir.
- run with *python app.py -d* command. This set a hardcode environment variables
- access to gmail account to see te result (**mail:** *test.storicard@gmail.com*, **pwd:** *JCRStoriCard2022*). **This account will be delete automatically the next week**
